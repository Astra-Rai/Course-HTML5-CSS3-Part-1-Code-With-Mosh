    If multiple rules target the same element, the brower will apply the rule that it is more specific:

    - ID selector: very specific, we cannot have two elements w/the same ID
    - Class and attribute selectors: less specific than ID b/c we can have multiple elements with the same class or attribute
    - Element Selector: b/c we can have many elements of a given type
