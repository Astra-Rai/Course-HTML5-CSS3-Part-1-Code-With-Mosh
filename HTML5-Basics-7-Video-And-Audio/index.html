    video element media  properties:

        - playbackRate
        - buffered
        - duration

        Safari and Chrome on Desktop do not like DOM manipulation around the video tag. They will not fire the play order when the autoplay attribute is set even if the canplaythrough event has fired 
        the DOM around the video tag has changed after initial page load.
